        <p>My name is Steve M Morehead III.  I currently live in Pensacola, FL, home of the USN Blue Angels. When I'm not pounding the keyboard, I enjoy being in/on the water.</p>

        <p>I first got excited about computers, as a young boy back in the mid 80's with a Tandy TRS-80! Though I spent many hours with it, as time passed, computers got more powerful and easily surpassed my ability to afford them.</p>

        <p>As I got older, most of my professional life was spent as a truck driver, but in the late 90's I was finally able to get back into computers.  By the early 00's I was starting to learn HTML/CSS.   I also found Linux and jumped right in by going straight to Gentoo!</p>

        <p>As a hobbyist, I spent most of my time gaming and learning to mod games.  After 2010 (ish), I got more into watching tutorials and seeking out other programming resources for languages such as C/C++, Java and Python.  I managed to create a few apps for personal use, but I was always leary of the quality of my code.  I had never had anyone look over my work before.  A few years later, I would take some courses on EdX and continue my growth.</p>

        <p>In late August 2019, driving a truck was taking it's toll on my knees and I needed to look for a career that was less physical. I learned about a unique learning experience called Lambda School.   I quickly signed up and started classes on Sept. 3rd in the Web24 cohort.</p>

        <p>Moving into 2020, I have completed the full-stack coursework and have started working as a Team Lead for the Web28 cohort.</p>
